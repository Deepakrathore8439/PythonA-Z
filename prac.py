#sum of two number 

# a = 2
# b = 4
# sum = a + b
# print(f"the sum of {a} and {b} is {sum}")


# subtraction of two number
# a=2
# b=5
# sub= a-b
# print(f"the subtracrtion of {a} and {b} is {sub}")

# print(f"the divide of {a} and {b} is {a/b}")

#expression execution 
# str  and numeric values can operate together with * operator

# A,B = 2,3
# Txt = "@"

# print(A*Txt*B)

# print(2*"@"*3)
# print(2*Txt*3)


# # str and str can operate with + operater

# a,b ="2",3
# txt ="@"
# print((a+txt)*b)

#numeric  values can operate with all arithmetic operator 

# a , b = 2,3
# c =4
# print((a+b*c))

#arithmetic expression with integer and float will result in float

# a , b = 10 , 5.34
# c = a*b
# print(c)
# print(a+b)
# print(type(c))

#result of division operator  with two integers will be float

# a,b=1,2
# c=a/b
# print(c)

#integer division with float and integer will give int displayed as float

# a,b =1.4,4
# c=a//b
# print(c)

# floor gives closest integer which is lesser than or equal to the float value result of a//b is a same as floor a/b
# a,b =16,5
# c=a//b
# print(c)

# a,b =-16,5
# c=a//b
# print(c)

# a,b =16,-5
# c=a//b
# print(c)

# reminder is (-ve ) when denominator is (-ve)

# a,b =-16,5
# c=a/b
# print(c)

# a,b =16,5
# c=a/b
# print(c)

# a,b =16,-5
# c=a/b
# print(c)
